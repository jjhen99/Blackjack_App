# Blackjack_App
This is an app version of Blackjack. I am using this as a learning endeavour for Kotlin, Java and Android Studio.
This project is still a work-in-progress and is far from finished. 
All of the backend code and game logic has been added, now I must find a way to start and play the game using the app UI.
